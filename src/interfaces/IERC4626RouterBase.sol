/** 
 @title ERC4626Router Base Interface
 @author joeysantoro
 @notice A canonical router between ERC4626 Vaults https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626

 The base router is a multicall style router inspired by Uniswap v3 with built-in features for permit, WETH9 wrap/unwrap, and ERC20 token pulling/sweeping/approving.
 It includes methods for the four mutable ERC4626 functions deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem as well.

 These can all be arbitrarily composed using the multicall functionality of the router.

 NOTE the router is capable of pulling any approved token from your wallet. This is only possible when your address is msg.sender, but regardless be careful when interacting with the router or ERC4626 Vaults.
 The router makes no special considerations for unique ERC20 implementations such as fee on transfer. 
 There are no built in protections for unexpected behavior beyond enforcing the minSharesOut is received.
